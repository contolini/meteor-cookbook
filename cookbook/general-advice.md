## General Advice

Here are some general tips and advice on writing Meteor applications.

#### More Growing, Less Engineering
- Think more organically, and try to grow your application, rather than engineer it.  Discover the correct syntax through refactoring, rather than assume a 'best practices' approach or try to force Meteor to work like an object-oriented framework.  Meteor is a different breed of framework, and simply works differently than object-oriented LAMP stacks.  There's this whole concept of scoping, and you'll find yourself constantly moving things around to fit into different scopes.  That moving of things around makes refactoring tools invaluable.  

    ``Use tools that support refactoring, such as WebStorm or Sublime3``.  

#### Use Your CSS Preprocessor  
-  Meteor supports a number of CSS preprocessors, including LESS and SASS.  If you've never used a preprocessor before, be ready for a delightful surprise.  They're the bomb.  Be enthusiastic and generous in offloading anything you can into your CSS.  There's a lot of CSS that is GPU accelerated, which will make your entire project perform better.  Be aware that LESS can be used to create class inheritance structures.  And the @media statements are a key ingredient in creating mobile-ready sites.  And the more functionality that is offloaded into CSS, that's less functionality that you have to manage in Javascript.  Which will make your app run faster.

    ``meteor add less``.  


#### Reconcile Your MVC With Isomorphic Javascript 
- Keep an open mind to what you know about MVC patterns, and what you have to do to implement them.  Meteor is an isomorphic framework, meaning it uses Javascript on both the server and the client.  This is great!  But it turns out that, over the years, server-side developers and client-side developers have developed different interpretations of what MVC means.  Client side and business-level MVC patterns generally include styling and CSS in their understanding of a View, whereas server side MVC patterns generally don't.  So, those differing understandings of what MVC is, they have to be reconciled.  Also, don't reimplement what already exists with Backbone, Angular, Ember, Knockout, or any of the other MVC frameworks.  All that functionality is already baked into Meteor.  Learn to use the existing feature set.
 
#### Application Global Scope
- Meteor introduces an application global scope.  Embrace it through the use of Session.get() and Session.set(), complex_session_variable_names, and camelCaseSyntax.  Once you get accustomed to doing things like Session.set('current_page', '#profilePage') and Session.get('is_sidebar_visible') in the global scope, the entire framework becomes *sooo* much simpler to use.  Be aware that while Session variables, and variables declared without the ``var`` keyword are global to the application, they're not global throughout the entire Javascript machine.  They are a happy medium, where your variables are scoped correctly, and can be shared between files, but aren't truly global and will cause name collisions down the road.  

    ````js
    // a valid variable assignment that can be shared accross files
    foo = true; 
    
    // entropy rich function name that is unlikely to case a name collission
    toggleSessionObjects(objectId)
    ````

#### Less Objects, More Functions 
- Rethink your usage of objects and inheritance.  Javascript is a functional language, at its core.  In my experience, one gets way more milage out of creating Monads, rather than Classes.  Creating class hierarchies is a good way to get frustrated with Meteor.   Most of what you're trying to do with class inheritance, to create various types of widgets, can be done with a monad decorator pattern.  Generally speaking, the fewer objects you create on the heap, the happier you'll be.  


#### Use the Filesystem for Workflow Components  
- And finally, I recommend not using the filesystem as a namespace for Classes, as you may be accustomed to in object-oriented frameworks.  Use the filesystem as a namespace for Workflow components instead...  pages, modaldialogs, importers, reports, etc.  I find that the workflow components namespace generally gets replicated three times... in the lib, stylesheets, and templates directories, respectively, and reflecting the MVC components.  When refactoring out a package, grab the appropriate file from each of the directories (ie. profile.html, profile.css, profile.js, for example), and put them into a single directory under the packages directory.  

#### Modularize Your Code  
- Create a ``/packages`` directory in the root directory, and refactor code out of your application into reusable modular packages.  If you're not familiar with maintaining larger, modularized applications, the general feel of it will be that of moving code between files, and moving files between directories.  You can use packages to create javascript namespaces and dependencies.

#### Everything is a List    
- Well, technically, everything is a string.  And those strings are parsed up into lists.  And Node.js is based on Javascript, which is based on ActionScript, which is based on Schema, which is based on Lisp, which stands for "List Processor".  Dig deep enough, and Javascript is all about lists.  Objects are just lists.  Arrays are lists.  Regexes are... well, regexes are string masking/parsing functions.  But same basic thing.
