# Test Driven Development

For an introduction to different types of tests (unit, integration, functional, acceptance, regression, smoke tests), see these StackOverflow questions: [unit/integration/functional/acceptance](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-test), [integration/smoke/regression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/520064/what-is-unit-test-integration-test-smoke-test-regression-test?lq=1).

## Frameworks

So, the bad news is that the test driven development in Meteor is still somewhat in its infancy.  The good news is that it's starting to mature, with a number of different approaches being investigated.  So, maybe it's more of a toddler than an infant.   

Regardless, if you'd like a comprehensive rundown of the options, keep tabs on the following feature comparison table:  
http://safety-harness.meteor.com/features

### [Tinytest](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/tinytest)

Meteor's [undocumented](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/04/04/meteor-060-brand-new-distribution-system-app-packages-npm-integration) but built-in basic unit testing for writing packages, with some [helpers](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/test-helpers). You can test your app that way too if you package it as a Meteor package, which amounts to adding a `package.js file`.

* [Tinytest integration with Travis CI](https://github.com/arunoda/travis-ci-meteor-packages)

### Mocha-Web

Basic unit test runner and HTML reporter, that can be installed as a package.

### [RTD](http://rtd.xolv.io) With Selenium, Mocha, Jasmine, and Istanbul
In-depth unit testing and acceptance testing; relies on a command line interface, and requires the app code to live in an `app` directory. [Inpsired by](http://blog.madeye.io/2013/02/testing-meteor-here-at-madeye-were-big.html?showComment=1364314050448#c7796997551340499047) Mocha-Web.

* CoinsManager - [large-ish code base using RTD](https://github.com/CoinsManager/CoinsManager)

RTD [plans to integrate Laika](https://github.com/xolvio/rtd/issues/63).

### [Laika](http://arunoda.github.io/laika/)
Integration testing using a command line interface, with a [somewhat convoluted API](https://github.com/arunoda/laika/issues/97).  Handy for engineering extensions to Meteor itself.  [Doesn't provide code coverage](https://github.com/xolvio/rtd/issues/22#issuecomment-20442959).

### Safety Harness
